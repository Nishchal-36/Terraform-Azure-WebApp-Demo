Overview
This repository demonstrates how to deploy an Azure web application infrastructure using modular Terraform code. Key components—resource group, networking, load balancer, and virtual machines—are each defined in separate modules for flexibility and clarity.

How It Works
Modules:

resource-group: Creates the Azure Resource Group.

networking: Sets up Virtual Network and Subnets.

load-balancer: Provisions an Azure Load Balancer.

virtual-machines: Deploys Virtual Machines connected to your VNet/LB.

Declarative Approach:
You define what resources you want and their basic configuration in .tf files; Terraform takes care of the how.

Variables and Outputs:
Each module uses variables for input and outputs for sharing key values between modules—making your infrastructure reusable and composable.

Quickstart
Configure Variables

Edit terraform.tfvars or set values using environment variables for things like locations, VM sizes, and credentials.

Initialize Terraform

Run: terraform init

Validate & Preview

Run: terraform validate

(Optional) See what will happen: terraform plan

Deploy

Run: terraform apply

Security Tips
DO NOT hardcode sensitive info (like VM passwords).

Use variables marked as sensitive or a secret manager.
